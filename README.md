# Upwork Match Intelligence Extension ⚡

Upwork Match Intelligence (UMI) is a high-alpha proposal reconnaissance tool designed for senior freelancers. It transforms the Upwork feed into a technical "God View" by anchoring buried metadata, performing skills gap analysis, and providing strategic AI insights.

## 🚀 Key Problems Solved

1.  **Hidden Client Intent**: Upwork hides "Activity on this job" (Interviews, Invites, Last Viewed) behind a click. UMI anchors this directly to the job tile.
2.  **Skills Blindness**: Instantly see if you are missing "Mandatory Skills" without opening the project.
3.  **Low-Trust Detection**: Highlighting payment verification and low hire rates (<30%) as tactical "Red Flags".
4.  **Proposal Over-saturation**: Capping scores for jobs with 50+ proposals to prevent wasting connects on saturated markets.
5.  **AI Strategic Advantage**: Dynamic pitch hooks and winning strategies based on deep project telemetry.

## 🧠 Scoring Architecture

The "Alpha Score" (0-100%) is calculated using a multi-factor regression heuristic:

| Factor               | Weight     | Alpha Rationale                                   |
| :------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trust Layer**      | +/- 20%    | Payment Verified? Hiring History?                 |
| **Skills Alignment** | + 40%      | Direct overlap with your Synced Profile skills.   |
| **Mandatory Skills** | - 15% / ea | Penalty for missing explicit client requirements. |
| **Financial Fit**    | + 15%      | Does the budget/rate floor meet your settings?    |
| **Saturation**       | - 25%      | Penalty for 50+ proposals (Saturation Shield).    |
| **Recency Alpha**    | + 15%      | Bonus if client viewed the job "Seconds ago".     |
| **Collaboration**    | + 20%      | History with you or similar profiles.             |

## 🛠️ Tactical Interface (God View)

UMI purges visual noise (Budget, Spent, Type) that you can already see, focusing on high-value intelligence:

- **Activity Hub**: Real-time Proposals, Interviews, and Invites Sent.
- **Client Dossier**: Total Hires, Active Projects, and Avg Hourly Rate Paid.
- **Skills Alignment**: Highlighted matched skills and warnings for missing mandatory skills.
- **Strategic Panel**: Advice strip with actionable signals (e.g., "GHOST JOB", "ALPHA SIGNAL").

## ⚡ Setup & Sync

1.  **Install**: Load the unpacked extension in Chrome.
2.  **Sync Intelligence**: Visit your [Upwork Profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~) once. The extension will auto-sync your skills and current rate into the intelligence engine.
3.  **Deploy**: Refresh your "Find Work" feed. Your "God View" is now active.
