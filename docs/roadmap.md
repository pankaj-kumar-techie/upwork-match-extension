# 🚀 Strategic Product Roadmap: Upwork Match Intelligence

Our mission is to evolve from a "Job Scorer" to a **Full-Cycle Alpha Agent**. This roadmap highlights the primary integration phases.

## 🟢 PHASE 1: Data Mastery (Current)

- ✅ **Deep Scraper v3**: Background activity and client dossiers.
- ✅ **Strategic Panel**: High-density UI for job cards.
- ✅ **Profile Sync**: One-click intelligence calibration.
- ✅ **Auto-Reload**: Autonomous feed refreshing.

## 🟡 PHASE 2: Cognitive Integration (NEXT)

- 🏗️ **LLM Model Support**: Direct integration with Gemini and OpenAI for job analysis.
- 🏗️ **Proposal Architect**: Auto-drafting cover letters using job-specific "Alpha Data".
- 🏗️ **Smart Summarizer**: Bullet-point reduction of long, messy job descriptions.

## 🔵 PHASE 3: Workflow Automation

- **Auto-Bid Pilot**: Pre-fill application forms based on match score.
- **Client Intent Analyzer**: Sentiment analysis on client reviews to detect "Micro-Managers" vs "High-Trust" clients.
- **Velocity Tracker**: Real-time proposal speed analytics to detect "Hot Posts".

## 🔴 PHASE 4: Professional Network

- **Collaboration Mode**: Shared intelligence pool for agencies.
- **Contract Risk Scanner**: Scans job posts for predatory legal terms or unrealistic scope.

## 🛠️ Upcoming: AI Intelligence Module

We are currently building the foundation for Phase 2. The next update will include:

1. **Model Selection**: Choose between `Gemini-1.5-Pro`, `GPT-4o`, or `Local LLM`.
2. **Key Store**: Secure local storage for API keys.
3. **Context Injection**: Feed job intel + your profile bio directly into the model for "Winning Logic" generation.
